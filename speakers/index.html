<p><strong>The Case for Lockless Concurrency</strong></p>
<p>In this tutorial we&#8217;ll learn how to exploit parallelism without locks. We&#8217;ll examine lockless shared-memory concurrency using software transactional memory, and use the actor model to show why computational models of the inherently parallel real world are easiest to construct and reason about using concurrency-oriented programming languages. We&#8217;ll see why immutable state is desirable in concurrent programs, and how to model the transient and stateful world without explicit mutation.

<h2>Harry Brundage</h2>
<p><strong>Shopify, JavaScript Developer</strong><br />
Harry Brundage is a developer at <a href="http://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, where he works on Shopify&#8217;s next generation web applications in Ruby and JavaScript. He enjoys working on <a href="http://batmanjs.org/">Batman.js</a>: an absurdly named but awesome CoffeeScript single page web application framework, listening to music, and eating poutine. The latter is done best at La Banquise in Montreal, which he fervently suggests you visit during your stay.</p>
<p><strong>Batman.js: Fighting Crime and Kicking Apps</strong><br />
Batman.js is Shopify’s latest open source project: a CoffeeScript framework for building awesome single page web applications. Batman abstracts away all sorts of difficulties the average developer might encounter when trying to build a high class experience on the web, including querying RESTful APIs, pushState &#038; hash-bang routing, HTML templating, and bindings to observable properties. It’s really Rails-y but works with other backends too.</p>
<p>In the tutorial we will go over how to build a Todo manager application using Batman, in just a few lines of HTML and JavaScript. A sample template will be provided for download. Once setup, we will step a few rounds of changes to the template to get to the final application in order to show you how to leverage the power of Batman, and build awesome web applications quickly.

<p><strong>Code Injection for Fun and Profit</strong><br />
Ever since Dropbox has launched, it has had deep integration with the Finder, Apple&#8217;s file manager for Mac OS X. What most people don&#8217;t know is that Apple doesn&#8217;t actually provide any APIs for third-parties to integrate with the Finder. In this talk we&#8217;ll explain the low-level binary code injection techniques used on Mac OS X to get the Finder to include Dropbox in the toolbar, sidebar, context menu, and over each file icon.

<p><strong>Genetec, Software Engineers</strong><br />
The past decade has seen a tremendous growth in the use of IP technologies. We are now in constant contact with devices that can share information on a network, and the array of possibilities this offers is almost infinite.</p>
<p>One industry that has had some great interest in the use of IP technology is the field of video surveillance. Video cameras and DVRs are now being replaced by network cameras that encode the images it captures in order to stream them over the network. Amongst the benefits of this shift from the analog to the digital world is the increased flexibility regarding archiving, indexing and viewing of video streams.</p>
<p>This presentation will review some basic network programming concepts and will serve as a crash-course into the world of IP video security. We will detail the tools of the trade and describe the daily challenges we face when it comes to integrating IP cameras in large-scale, professional video surveillance software.

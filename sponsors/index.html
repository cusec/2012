<h4>Dropbox</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> was founded in 2007 by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi. Frustrated by working from multiple computers, Drew was inspired to create a service that would let people bring all their files anywhere, with no need to email around attachments. Drew created a demo of Dropbox and showed it to fellow MIT student Arash Ferdowsi, who dropped out with only one semester left to help make Dropbox a reality. Guiding their decisions was a relentless focus on crafting a simple and reliable experience across every computer and phone. Drew and Arash moved to San Francisco in fall 2007, secured seed funding from Y Combinator, and set about building a world-class engineering team. In fall 2008, Sequoia Capital led a $7.2M Series A with Accel Partners to help bring Dropbox to people everywhere. Recently, Dropbox&#8217;s tremendous growth was evidenced by its October 2011 announcement of nearly 50 million users.</p>
